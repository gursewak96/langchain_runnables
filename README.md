# LangChain Runnable Examples 😉

Welcome to the LangChain Runnable Examples repository! 🚀 This repository contains Python examples demonstrating the usage of different Runnable components in LangChain.

## 📌 Overview

LangChain's Runnable modules provide a flexible way to build and execute computation graphs efficiently. This repo includes examples of:

- RunnableSequence 🔄 - Running a sequence of steps in order.

- RunnableParallel ⚡ - Executing multiple tasks in parallel.

- RunnableBranch 🌿 - Choosing different execution paths dynamically.

- RunnablePassthrough 🔁 - Passing data through without modification.

- RunnableLambda 🏗️ - Defining custom logic on the fly.

Each example is provided as a separate Python file (.py) for easy reference and execution.
